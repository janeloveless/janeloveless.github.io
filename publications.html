			beautiful work</a>
		from Tosif Ahamed, Antonio Costa, and Greg Stephens, which convinced

		<b>A physical theory of larval <i>Drosophila</i> behaviour.</b> (2020)
		Jane Loveless, Alastair Garner, Abdul Raouf Issa, Barbara Webb,
		Tomoko Ohyama & Claudio R. Alonso.
		<i>in preparation</i>. A biorxiv pre-print is available

		This paper represents the culmination of a collaboration with the
		experimental laboratories of 
		<a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/alonsolab/">Claudio Alonso</a> 
		and 
		<a href="https://tomoko-oyama.squarespace.com/#tomokolabhome">Tomoko Ohyama</a>, at the
		University of Sussex and Mcgill University, respectively. In the
		paper, I develop a simple effective theory for larval behaviour from
		basic symmetry arguments, that predicts/explains features of real
		larval behaviour surprisingly well. Somewhat bizarrely, the theory is
		able to capture several behaviours while remaining almost completely
		agnostic as to their "neural substrates". Furthermore, our analysis
		shows that several larval behaviours display classical equilibrium
		(Boltzmann) statistics, with the apparent low dimensionality of
		behaviour emerging due to Boltzmann suppression of higher frequency
		postural modes.

		This pair of papers represents the bulk of my PhD research, conducted
		under the supervision of Barbara Webb and in collaboration with
		Konstantinos Lagogiannis. In these papers we build a theory of larval
		exploratory behaviour that is mechanistically grounded in the
		deterministic chaotic physics of the animal's body. In this theory,
		exploration emerges as a type of deterministic diffusion process. The
		second paper introduces sensory cues that can shape the chaotic
		exploration process to achieve taxis, i.e. to bring the larva towards
		"favourable" conditions and away from "unfavourable" ones.
