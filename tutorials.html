		My plan is to use this page to share educational resources that I
		have found useful, and to share some insights of my own. Hopefully
		this will help others out there trying to learn theory through
		self-study.

		<br>
		<br>

		The core mathematics that any working scientist should be familiar
		with is included in a set of three lecture courses in the typical
		undergraduate curriculum: Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Differential
		Equations. I learned these subjects using MIT OpenCourseWare, and
		then refined my knowledge by working on projects and setting fun
		problems for myself.  
		Here is a breakdown:

		<br>
		<br>


		<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">
			<b>Linear Algebra</b></a>, taught by Gilbert Strang. When it comes
		to maths, I was a late starter. 
		I followed this course at 23 after not doing any maths since
		finishing high school at 16, and it opened my eyes to how beautiful
		the subject can be. Gilbert Strang's enthusiasm for the subject
		shines, and because of the clarity with which he expresses the key
		ideas, that enthusiasm is infectious. If you're like me, and are
		trying to learn advanced maths after hating it in school, or after a
		long break, there is no better (re)introduction than this series of
		video lectures. Strang's textbooks are also excellent and I highly
		recommend them for self-study.

		<br>
		<br>

		<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/">
			<b>Single Variable Calculus</b></a>, taught by David Jensen.
		I have heard that nobody enjoys learning calculus, and nobody enjoys
		teaching calculus. That definitely fits with my own experiences.  I
		personally found this lecture series to be a total slog compared to
		Strang's linear algebra, but in the long run it has been <i>very</i>
		worthwhile. 

		<br>
		<br>

		<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/">
			<b>Differential Equations</b></a>, taught by Arthur
		Mattuck. This course of video lectures just flew by for me; I loved
		it! Most of the content is practically very useful for analysing real
		problems, and the instructors highlight a whole bunch of interesting
		applications. For me, manipulating and studying differential
		equations was where learning calculus really started to pay off.

		<br>
		<br>

		The following is a list of resources that I've found useful. I'll
		gradually add comments on each, as time allows.
