		<h2>Personal Background</h2>
		
		I am a queer transsexual. 

		<br>
		<br>

		I use they/them or she/her pronouns. 

		<br>
		<br>

		I study the theoretical physics of animal behaviour.

		<br>
		<br>

		I play drums and make zines for PETROLEUM GENDERLOSS!, my noise band.

		<br>
		<br>

		I absolutely love cutting hair.

		<h2>Academic Background</h2>

		I am currently a post-doctoral scholar in Greg Stephens' 
		<a href="https://groups.oist.jp/bptu">Biological Physics Theory Unit</a>
		at the 
		<a href="https://oist.jp">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)</a>.

		<br>
		<br>

		I completed my PhD in Barbara Webb's 
		<a href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/insectrobotics/">Insect Robotics Laboratory</a>, 
		which is based within the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.

		<br>
		<br>

		Between finishing my PhD and starting work with Greg, I worked
		"freelance" as a theoretician, collaborating with the experimental
		laboratories of 
		<a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/alonsolab/">Claudio Alonso</a> 
		and 
		<a href="https://tomoko-oyama.squarespace.com/#tomokolabhome">Tomoko Ohyama</a>. 

		<br>
		<br>

		I completed my undergraduate degree, BSc (Hons) Biomedical Sciences
		(Neuroscience), within the School of Biomedical Sciences at the
		University of Edinburgh.

		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Research</h2>

		I am broadly interested in the theoretical physics of animal
		behaviour. I want to see how far we can go in understanding living,
		behaving organisms by applying the same tools that are used to
		understand non-living systems. I suppose this reflects a conviction
		that there should be no huge difference between the two.
		My work draws on analytical mechanics, dynamical systems, statistical
		mechanics; I am being increasingly drawn into quantum field theory,
		condensed matter theory, and kinetic theory. 

		<br>
		<br>

		During my PhD I built biomechanical models of the <i>Drosophila</i>
		larva (fruitfly maggot) which suggested the physics of the animal's
		body should give rise to deterministic yet inherently unpredictable
		movement. I harnessed this description to build elegant
		neuromechanical models of the animals' exploration behaviour, both in
		the presence and absence of external sensory cues.
		
		<br>
		<br>

		Since then, I've been engaged in close experimental collaborations
		with Claudio Alonso and Tomoko Ohyama, developing simple equilibrium
		effective field theories of larval behaviours. Amazingly, our
		approach allows us to explain and predict detailed features of animal
		behaviour based only on symmetry considerations, without having to
		say much about the nervous system at all.

		<br>
		<br>

		<!--I'm still finding my feet at OIST, but I plan on working on some of
		the many fascinating issues around the effective theory approach to
		understanding behaviour, both extending this approach to other
		animals such as the nematode worm <i>C. elegans</i> and attempting to
		figure out exactly why the approach should work at all, since
		intuitively we feel the details of the nervous system <i>should</i>
		be important for behaviour.-->
		
		More recently, I've started applying similar approaches to understand
		the behaviour of the nematode worm <i>C.  elegans</i>, and I'm
		continuing to try and probe exactly why these "simple" theoretical
		approaches work in the first place.

		<h2>Teaching</h2>

		I've taught a range of topics within biomedical sciences,
		informatics, and robotics. 

		<br>
		<br>

		I am particularly interested in teaching mathematics and the
		rudiments of (formal, mathematical) theoretical science to
		biologists. 
		We are generally not taught how to build or even interpret formal
		theories during our training, which is a great disservice -- I
		strongly believe that mathematics is the best language we have to
		describe nature.

		<br>
		<br>

		I am always happy to tutor other biologists (at any stage of their
		career) in mathematics, physics, and coding. I can also provide
		self-teaching references, and guide you through the process of
		teaching yourself about these areas.
		Shoot me an email at jane-loveless [at] oist.jp if you are
		interested. 
		If we cover topics which I believe should be of general interest I
		will add my notes to this website <a href="tutorials.html">here</a>.
