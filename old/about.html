		My name is Dylan Ross. This is my personal website. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a PhD student working in Barbara Webb's Insect
		Robotics Group at the School of Informatics, University
		of Edinburgh. I am also a member of Adam Stokes' Soft
		Systems Group at the same University. My research is
		focused on maggots (<i> Drosophila melanogaster </i>
		larvae) and how they crawl around. I use classical
		physics to describe the body of the maggot and its
		interaction with the environment, and build
		mathematical models describing crawling-relevant parts
		of its brain at varying levels of abstraction.
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a musician and sound engineer. I usually perform
		using a prepared guitar and a laptop. My music is close
		to noise, drone, and post-rock. There is usually a
		strong emotional component to my music; hopefully that
		comes across. I previously ran the sound team at a
		local community arts space, <!-- TODO link --> and have
		occasionally done session studio and external recording
		work. I've struggled to find time for music while doing
		my PhD, but recently started to carve out weekends and
		evenings for practise and recording. I hope to share
		some of the results here soon.
		<br>
		<br>
		I once drew a series of comics. If I can find the time,
		I'd love to write some more and get them up on here.
		<!-- I study how fruitfly larvae (maggots) wiggle about
		and move through their environment. I ask, what are the
		mechanics of maggots, and how can their nervous systems
		use this to their advantage? -->
