		I teach on the following undergraduate courses at the
		University of Edinburgh:
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Cells to Organisms</b> -- I maintain an online
		simulation of cell proliferation and differentiation,
		which students use in a ``dry'' practical. The students
		have to experiment with different division, death, and
		differentiation rates to produce robust populations of
		each cell type in appropriate proportions.
		<br>
		<br>

		<b>System Design Project</b> -- I mentor a team of ~6
		students as they build a LEGO robot capable of playing
		football. The students build the physical robot from
		scratch, and also have to write their own sensing,
		planning, and control code.
		<br>
		<br>

		<b>Intelligent Autonomous Robotics</b> -- I help my
		supervisor, Barbara Webb, run a series of practicals in
		which students must program a Khepera robot to perform
		tasks autonomously (i.e. without human intervention).
		Tasks include avoiding obstacles, performing odometry /
		dead reckoning, and collecting and returning ``food''
		to a ``nest''. 
		<br>
		<br>
			
		<b>General Neuroscience</b>
		<br>
		<br>

		I also teach on the following masters-level courses :
		<br>
		<b>Introduction to Bioelectronics</b>
